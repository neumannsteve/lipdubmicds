<h1>What is Lip Dub MICDS 2018?</h1>

<p>This is a project to orchestrate a lip dub for MICDS in 2018. We plan to 
showcase the entire campus in the video, as well as some of the amazing groups
we have on campus.</p>

<h1>When will it happen?</h1>

<p>April 24, 2018. We'll start in Advisory from 8:00am to 8:15am, and then do
the shoot from 8:20am to 9:20am, followed by an all-school assembly.</p>

<h1>Who Is Running This?</h1>

<p>Sebastian Neumann is a ninth grader at MICDS, and as a new student he was
amazed by all of the great facilities the school has. He wanted to show the
rest of the St. Louis community (and beyond) all the wonderful things MICDS
has to offer. Around the same time, a school in Kansas City, his home town,
made a lip dub, and that spurred him into action. Now, he hopes he can show
everyone how amazing it is to be a Ram.</p>

<h1>Who Is Part of the Leadership Team?</h1>

<p>The leadership team will be selected randomly from among those who sign up
through <a href="/signup/leadership.html">this link</a>. The administration has
agreed to grant <b>five</b> service hours if you are selected to join the
leadership team.</p>

<h1>Who is Performing?</h1>

performer, sign up through <a href="/signup/performer.html">this link</a>.</p>
